# ⚙ LeopphEngine ⚙

## About the project
LeopphEngine (pronounced "lœff") is a C++ game engine. It's my CS BSc thesis, so its development is slow, and its features are limited, but always expanding. It's name, as stupid as it may sound, is derived from my last name. No, I couldn't come up with anything better. Yes, seriously.

## Ideology
LeopphEngine builds around the idea of ease of use. Its API is designed so that is resembles higher-level managed language APIs so that common functionality is easily accessible to everyone. Most of the functions and objects the library provides take care of lifetimes and pointer correctness, so developers can focus on the big picture rather than trying to debug a leak or a crash. This is all done in a way that doesn't trade in very much performance, so that software built around LeopphEngine can still harness close to all of the running machine's power.  
For those who like to play with lower-level stuff and are not afraid to dirty their hands, LeopphEngine provides a yet handful, but ever-growing set of APIs that allow more control and faster execution, but provide less or even no management and safety.

## Documentation
I'm trying to place as much info into header/module files as I can. For now, developers can use these to get more info on specific behaviors. I will eventually create standalone documentation about all the different APIs LeopphEngine provides.

## Support and Usage
### Build requirements
- Windows
- MSBuild
- MSVC v143 toolset
- CMake
- Python 2.7 or newer
### Runtime requirements
- Windows
- OpenGL 4.5 compatible GPU
### Building
- Run **setup.bat** from the root directory
  - This pulls all submodules, then configures and builds all dependencies under *LeopphEngine/vendor*
- Build the solution in the root directory.  
### Consumption
To use LeopphEngine in your application:
- Include **Leopph.hpp** from **LeopphEngine/include**
- Either
  - Link against **leopph.lib**, and copy **leopph.dll** (both found in **LeopphEngine/*<target_config>***) to your output directory, or
  - Load **leopph.dll** manually through the Windows API

## Branches and Releases
Development of LeopphEngine takes place on two branches.  
- The **master** branch always contains the latest code that is verified to compile and be stable, and can be used for game development purposes. Features may disappear from it, so it is in no way a "release" channel, but it is the most stable, slowest branch that never contains code that hasn't passed the dev branch.  
- The **dev** branch is where all the new stuff goes. As soon as anything changes, it is reflected in this channel. Features are highly volatile here, code may be heavily buggy, incomplete, or even non-compiling. If you happen to check this branch out and spend some time exploring it, your comments and suggestions would be very welcome.
- There may appear other branches outside of the standard 2 branch setup. These can safely be ignored by developers as more than likely I just set them up for organizing development of a feature according to my personal taste.  

Every now and then I release "PB" builds. What does PB stand for? It may be "Public Beta". It could be "Published Build". It just might be "Product Breakthrough". Who knows? The versioning is simple: it is the date in the format **yymmdd** with an optional letter at the end in case there are multiple releases a day. Letters are added in alphabetic order.  
Example: LeopphEngine ***PB211223b***. This means, that the build came out on December 23rd, 2021, and it is the third release that day (since no letter would mean first and "a" would mean second).  
You may also find releases using an earlier versioning scheme. In the case of those builds, you can rely on higher numbers meaning later releases.
